A simple **Java-based Library Management System** that demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
This project allows management of **Books** and **Users**, with features to **issue** and **return books**.

## ✨ Features
- ➕ Add new Books and Users  
- 📖 Issue books to users  
- 🔄 Return issued books  
- 📋 Display all books with status (available/issued)  
- 💻 Interactive menu-driven program in terminal
